# Static Comp Challenge 1
## Katie Scruggs

For this project, I recreated the layout of the comp using flexbox CSS techniques. I chose to create a yoga portal for my design as I was choosing a yoga streaming service while I was creating this layout. For my color scheme, I uploaded my image to coolors.co to find hex codes of colors present in the image and add additional complementary colors. I found the icons at flaticon.com by FreePik, who is attributed on the Image Credits page. To make the site responsive, I used several breakpoints and chose a different crop of my image to use when it is in its header position.
